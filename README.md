# simple_sha256_BF
A simple python sha256 bruteforcing tool

How it works
1. Reads in encrypted password
2. Reads in a password list one password at a time
3. Encrypts the password it reads in
3. Compares the two encrypted passwords
4. If they match then it spits out the answer
5. If not it reads in next password and compares

In the folder that you have this script located, you must include
the password that you want to crack in a file called 'encrypted_pass'
and your password list must be in a file called 'password_list'
